# PCBS-DataAnalysis
My project will consist in creating a psychopathy factor with the UK Biobank. First, I will clean the data available and explore which variables I will include in my analyses. Then, I will perform factor analysis (EFA, CFA, hierarchical model) to see which model best fits the data. Finally, I will try to provide an interpretention of the results.
